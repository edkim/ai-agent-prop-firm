## Key Practices

- Always update README.md before git commits when features change
- Save accomplishments and analysis documents to ai-convo-history/ with date prefixes (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Use TodoWrite tool for tracking multi-step tasks
- Remember to always kill and restart the backend server before running any learning iterations or tests
- Check ai-convo-history/API-ENDPOINTS-REFERENCE.md for how to start a learning iteration
