# AI Backtest Platform - Project Memory

## Key Practices

- Always update README.md before git commits when features change
- Save analysis documents to ai-convo-history/ with date prefixes (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Use TodoWrite tool for tracking multi-step tasks
- Remember to always kill and restart the backend server before running any tests
