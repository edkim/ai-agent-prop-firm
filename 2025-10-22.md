# Development Plan - October 22, 2025

## Implemented: AI-Powered Backtest Routing System

### High-Level Steps Completed

1. **Created BacktestRouterService** - Intelligent routing engine that analyzes natural language prompts
   - Detects earnings queries, date ranges, specific dates, custom exit times
   - Routes to appropriate execution strategy (template API vs custom script)
   - Integrates with DateQueryService for earnings data lookup

2. **Created DateQueryService** - Database query service for special date filtering
   - Supports earnings date queries from database
   - Extensible for other date-based filters

3. **Created ORB Multi-Day Template** - Template for running strategies across multiple dates
   - Supports dynamic date injection
   - Handles custom exit times (noon, etc.)
   - Aggregates results across all dates

4. **Added Intelligent Endpoint** - New `/api/backtests/execute-intelligent` endpoint
   - Accepts natural language prompts
   - Automatically routes to best execution strategy
   - Returns routing decision for transparency

5. **Tested Implementation** - Verified with CRML multi-day backtest
   - Tested "past 9 days with noon exit" query
   - Results documented in CRML_ORB_RESULTS.md
   - Strategy showed 75% win rate, +$311 profit on 100 shares

### Next Steps (Verification)

1. Test simple strategy query through intelligent router
2. Test complex multi-day query through intelligent router
3. Verify routing decisions are optimal
4. Document example queries and expected routing
