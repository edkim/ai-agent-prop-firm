# 2025-11-06: Learning Iteration Research Plan

## Goal
Understand the current learning iteration implementation to plan how to add execution script improvement.

## Research Areas
1. API endpoints for learning iterations
2. Backtest analysis and Claude integration
3. Execution template selection and application
4. Refinement suggestion mechanism
5. Iteration loop architecture (N to N+1)

## Key Questions
- Where are learning iterations triggered?
- How does Claude analyze backtest results?
- How are execution templates currently selected?
- What's stored in agent_iterations table?
- How do refinements flow between iterations?

## Target Outcome
Detailed summary + key modification points for execution script evolution
